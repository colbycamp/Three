The enemy of thy enemy is thy friend.
Imagination is more important than knowledge.
The quality, not the longevity, of one's life is what is important.
Important principles may, and must, be inflexible.
Don't cry because it's over, smile because it happened.
Be yourself; everyone else is already taken.
You only live once, but if you do it right, once is enough.
Be the change that you wish to see in the world.
In three words I can sum up everything I've learned about life: it goes on.
No one can make you feel inferior without your consent.
A friend is someone who knows all about you and still loves you.
If you tell the truth, you don't have to remember anything.
Always forgive your enemies; nothing annoys them so much.
Live as if you were to die tomorrow. Learn as if you were to live forever.
It is easier for you to explain why you did a job rather than why you didn't.
Whatever the mind of man can conceive and believe, it can achieve.
I attribute my success to this: I never gave or took any excuse.
You miss 100 percent of the shots you don't take.
Every strike brings me closer to a home run.
The mind is everything. What you think you become.
An unexamined life is not worth living.
Eighty percent of success is showing up.
The best revenge is massive success.
